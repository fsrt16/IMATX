ðŸ“Š Cervical Cancer Detection using IMATX Network and Transfer Learning Approaches
This repository presents a collection of Jupyter Notebooks for cervical cancer classification using deep learning and machine learning methods on the SIPaKMeD dataset. The models include our proposed IMATX Net architecture, as well as transfer learning baselines like InceptionResNetV2 and VGG16. A comparative study of ML and DL techniques is also provided.

ðŸ§  Repository Structure
Notebook Filename	Description
imatx-net-pretrained-inceptionresnetv2-for-cervi.ipynb	Implements the IMATX Net, which integrates Multi-Attention and Pyramidal T-Block modules using InceptionResNetV2 as the backbone for accurate cervical cell classification. Includes performance metrics, heatmaps, and explainability.
tl-ablation-imatx-network-for-cervical.ipynb	Contains ablation study for the IMATX Net, comparing different architectural variants (with/without IMA, T-Blocks) and analyzing their performance contributions.
v2-pretrained-vgg16-for-cervicale.ipynb	Transfer Learning model using VGG16 pretrained weights on the SIPaKMeD dataset. Serves as a benchmark for comparison with IMATX.
sipakmed-comparative-study-ml-dl.ipynb	Comparative evaluation of various ML classifiers (SVM, KNN, Random Forest) and DL architectures. Helps understand baseline performance across traditional vs. deep methods.
